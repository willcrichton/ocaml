(** Intermediate language used to perform closure conversion and inlining.

    Closure conversion starts with [Lambda] code.  The conversion transforms
    function declarations into "sets of closures" ([Fset_of_closures]
    constructor) in the [Flambda] language.

    The usual case of a function declared on its own will produce a
    [Fset_of_closures] containing a single closure.  The closure itself may
    be accessed using [Fclosure] and specifies which variables (by name, not
    by any numeric offset) are free in the corresponding function definition.
    Occurrences of these free variables in the body appear as the usual
    [Fvar] expressions.

    For the case of multiple functions defined together, possibly mutually
    recursive, a [Fset_of_closures] value will be generated containing
    one closure per function.  Each closure may be accessed again using
    [Fclosure], specifying which function's closure is desired.

    As an example, the flambda representation of:

      {[let rec f x = ...
        and g x = ... ]}

    might be (for identifiers [f] and [g] corresponding to the variables of
    the same name in the source text):

      {[Flet( closure, Fset_of_closures { id_f -> ...; id_g -> ... },
              Flet(f, Fclosure { fu_closure = closure; fu_fun = id_f },
              Flet(g, Fclosure { fu_closure = closure; fu_fun = id_g },
              ...)))]}

    One can also use [Fclosure] to move between closures in the same set of
    closures.  For example for [f] and [g] as above, represented together as a
    set of closures, we might apply [Fclosure] to extract the closure for [g],
    and later decide to use [Fclosure] again on this value (not on the set of
    closures) to access the closure for [f].  This is used when inlining
    mutually-recursive functions as a means of avoiding having to keep around
    a value corresponding to the whole set of closures.  For example,
    continuing from the example above:

      {[ Fclosure { fu_closure = Fvar g; fu_fun = id_f;
                    fu_relative_to = Some id_g } ]}

    After closure conversion an inlining pass is performed.  This may
    introduce [Fvar_within_closure] expressions to represent accesses (from
    the body of inlined functions) to variables bound by closures.  Some of
    these [Fvar_within_closure] expressions may survive in the tree after
    inlining has finished.

    Other features of this intermediate language are:

    - Access to constants across modules are performed with respect to
      named symbols in the object file (of type [Symbol.t]).

    - Direct calls are distinguished from indirect calls (as in [Clambda])
      using values of type [call_kind].

    - Nodes making up an expression in the language may be annotated with
      arbitrary values (the ['a] in [type 'a flambda]).

    - "Structured constants" built from the constructors in type [const]
      are not explicitly represented.  Instead, they are converted into
      expressions such as: [Fprim (Pmakeblock(...), ...)].

  (** Parameters known to always alias some variable in the scope of the set
      of closures declaration. For instance, supposing all call sites of f
      are represented in this example,
        [let x = ... in
         let f a b c = ... in
         let y = ... in
         f x y 1;
         f x y 1]
      the specialised arguments of f can (but does not necessarily) contain
      the association [a] -> [x], but cannot contain [b] -> [y] because [f]
      is not in the scope of [y]. If f were the recursive function,
      [let rec f a b c = f a 1 2 in], [a] -> [x] whould still be a valid
      specialised argument because all recursive calls maintain the invariant.

      This information is used for optimisation purpose, if such a binding is
      known, it is possible to specialise the body of the function according
      to its parameter. This is usually introduced when specialising a recusive
      function, for instance.
        [let rec map f = function
           | [] -> []
           | h :: t -> f h :: map f t
         let map_succ l =
           let succ x = x + 1 in
           map succ l]
      [map] can be duplicated in [map_succ] to be specialised for the argument
      [f]. This will result in
        [let map_succ l =
           let succ x = x + 1 in
           let rec map f = function
             | [] -> []
             | h :: t -> f h :: map f t in
           map succ l]
      with map having [f] -> [succ] in his [cl_specialised_arg] field.

      Note that it is usually not correct to erase this information if the
      argument is used.
