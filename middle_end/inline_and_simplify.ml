(* Transform an expression denoting an access to a variable bound in
   a closure.  Variables in the closure ([project_var.closure]) may
   have been freshened since [expr] was constructed; as such, we
   must ensure the same happens to [expr].  The renaming information is
   contained within the approximation deduced from [closure] (as
   such, that approximation *must* identify which closure it is).

   For instance in some imaginary syntax for flambda:

     [let f x =
        let g y ~closure:{a} = a + y in
        let closure = { a = x } in
          g 12 ~closure]

   when [f] is traversed, [g] can be inlined, resulting in the
   expression

     [let f z =
        let g y ~closure:{a} = a + y in
        let closure = { a = x } in
          closure.a + 12]

   [closure.a] being a notation for:

     [Project_var{closure = closure; closure_id = g; var = a}]

   If [f] is inlined later, the resulting code will be

     [let x = ... in
      let g' y' ~closure':{a'} = a' + y' in
      let closure' = { a' = x } in
        closure'.a' + 12]

   in particular the field [a] of the closure has been alpha renamed to [a'].
   This information must be carried from the declaration to the use.

   If the function is declared outside of the alpha renamed part, there is
   no need for renaming in the [Ffunction] and [Project_var].
   This is not usualy the case, except when the closure declaration is a
   symbol.

   What ensures that this information is available at [Project_var]
   point is that those constructions can only be introduced by inlining,
   which requires that same information. For this to still be valid,
   other transformation must avoid transforming the information flow in
   a way that the inline function can't propagate it.

(* Transforms closure definitions by applying [loop] on the code of every
   one of the set and on the expressions of the free variables.
   If the substitution is activated, alpha renaming also occur on everything
   defined by the set of closures:
   * Variables bound by a closure of the set
   * closure identifiers
   * parameters

   The rewriting occurs in a clean environment without any of the variables
   defined outside reachable.  This helps increase robustness against accidental,
   potentially unsound simplification of variable accesses by
   [simplify_using_approx_and_env].

   The rewriting occurs in an environment filled with:
   * The approximation of the free variables
   * An explicitely unknown approximation for function parameters,
     except for those where it is known to be safe: those present in the
     [specialised_args] set.
   * An approximation for the closures in the set. It contains the code of
     the functions before rewriting.

   The approximation of the currently defined closures is available to
   allow marking recursives calls as direct and in some cases, allow
   inlining of one closure from the set inside another one. For this to
   be correct an alpha renaming is first applied on the expressions by
   [apply_function_decls_and_free_vars].

   For instance when rewriting the declaration

     [let rec f_1 x_1 =
        let y_1 = x_1 + 1 in
        g_1 y_1
      and g_1 z_1 = f_1 (f_1 z_1)]

   When rewriting this function, the first substitution will contain
   some mapping:
   { f_1 -> f_2;
     g_1 -> g_2;
     x_1 -> x_2;
     z_1 -> z_2 }

   And the approximation for the closure will contain

   { f_2:
       fun x_2 ->
         let y_1 = x_2 + 1 in
         g_2 y_1
     g_2:
       fun z_2 -> f_2 (f_2 z_2) }

   Note that no substitution is applied to the let-bound variable [y_1].
   If [f_2] where to be inlined inside [g_2], we known that a new substitution
   will be introduced in the current scope for [y_1] each time.


   If the function where a recursive one comming from another compilation
   unit, the code already went through [Flambdasym] that could have
   replaced the function variable by the symbol identifying the function
   (this occur if the function contains only constants in its closure).
   To handle that case, we first replace those symbols by the original
   variable.
