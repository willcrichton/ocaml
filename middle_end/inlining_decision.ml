      (* A function is considered for inlining if it does not increase the code
         size too much. This size is verified after effectively duplicating
         and specialising the code in the current context. In that context,
         some local calls can have new opportunity for inlining, for instance.
         [let f g x = g x + 1
          let h x = ...
          let v = f h 1]
         When inlining [f], [g] becomes known and so [h] can be inlined too.
         Inlining only [f] will usualy fit the size constraint and will be
         beneficial. But depending on [h] it can or cannot be beneficial to
         inline it: If [h] is too big, it may be possible to inline it in [f],
         but that may prevent [f] from being inlinable after verification.
         To prevent that, the maximal size increase allowed to [h] is reduced
         by what is consumed by [f].
         In the case of stub functions, we know that the function is small
         enouth and has a high probability of reducing the size of the
         code around it, hence we know that trying to inline it won't prevent
         the surrounding function from being inlined.

         CR pchambart: The case of functors should not be always treated as
           stub functions. It won't often decrease the function size hence
           will probably prevent a function from being inlined, loosing the
           benefit of the potential inlining.
           It may be reasonnable to consider that reavealing an opportunity
           for inlining a functor as sufficient for forced inlining.
         CR pchambart: The heuristic is half broken as the potential local
           inlines are not accumulated. For instance, in the previous example
           if f was [let f g x = g (g x)], if g was just bellow the quota,
           it could considered the two times.
           To correct that, the threshold should be propagated through [r]
           rather than [env]
